The application uses AWS Step Functions with AWS Lambda functions to process the files. The developer used Amazon API Gateway and Lambda functions to create an API to support the UI.<br/><br/>The company’s UI team reports that the request to process a file is often returning timeout errors because of the size or complexity of the files.
